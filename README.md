# 👋 Hi, I'm Vikram Singh

I'm a passionate data engineer and lifelong builder who loves untangling messy data and transforming it into meaningful systems. With over 4 years of experience across software development and data engineering, I've designed and scaled real-time pipelines, automated complex ETL workflows, and delivered analytics platforms that help people make better decisions.

I started in software but found my calling in data, where logic meets storytelling. Whether it's streaming billions of events through Kafka or helping teams visualize KPIs in Superset, I care about the *why* behind the work as much as the *how*.

What drives me most is curiosity. I ask questions until things make sense, and I keep learning until they make a difference. I believe the best data work happens when engineers, analysts, and domain experts come together to solve real problems — with empathy, creativity, and a healthy respect for detail.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me mentoring, nerding out over global economics, or sketching workflows in my head, fueled by way too much coffee.

🚀 Let's build systems that last — and matter.
